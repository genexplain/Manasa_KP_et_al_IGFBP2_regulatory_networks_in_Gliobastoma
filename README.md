1. **Workflow**
The current work analyses publicly available datasets of Glioblastoma multiforme to understand the gene regulatory networks driving short survival. To understand such gene regulatory networks, Genome Enhancer (https://ge.genexplain.com) pipeline developed based on the open source BioUML platform (www.biouml.org) is used. The pipeline uses Upstream Analysis protocol described earlier [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30999858/], which is an integrated promoter and pathway analysis, to identify potential drug targets of the studied pathology. Datasets used in the study, clinical info and workflow descriptions are described here as well as in the manuscript cited below. Results and the computational workflow are given public access.
